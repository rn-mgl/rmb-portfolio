app folder is the new pages

    export react components can be async in next 13 (not sure in 12)

    page.js is required as it is the index
    head.js is for the titles, metas, and icons
    layout.js is for the format "template" of the page, (but not exactly the template.js file), this is like the _app.js in next 12
